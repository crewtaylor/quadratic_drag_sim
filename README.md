# Quadratic Drag Simulation

I currently have the Falcon 9 projectile code commented out and the Boeing 737-900 altitude code not commented. The code needs cleaning up and refactoring for better understanding but it works. I am planning to split it up into two different files so they can be run separately. I will have this done by the final paper.
